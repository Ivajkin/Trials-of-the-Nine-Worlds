"Trials of the Nine Worlds" is an excellent title for a Norse mythology-inspired game, combining puzzle-platformer elements with cooperative gameplay. The focus on Odin, Loki, and Thor with their unique abilities provides opportunities for rich, varied gameplay.

For developing this game in Pygame, here are some additional suggestions and enhancements to deepen the experience:

Additional Features for "Trials of the Nine Worlds":
Realm Progression:

Players travel through nine realms of Norse mythology (e.g., Asgard, Midgard, Helheim), each with its unique set of puzzles, enemies, and environments.
As the player progresses, new enemies, mechanics, and abilities could be unlocked, expanding the gameplay depth.
Unique Level Designs:

Each realm could introduce a new puzzle mechanic or platforming challenge inspired by the realm's mythology. For example:
Helheim: Ghosts that follow the player, requiring players to use Loki’s illusions to escape.
Jotunheim: Giants that create obstacles, solved using Thor’s thunder to destroy barriers.
Multiplayer / Co-op Mode:

Implement a local or online co-op where players can control Odin, Loki, and Thor independently, requiring teamwork to solve puzzles in real-time.
Boss Fights:

Add bosses inspired by Norse mythology, like Fenrir (Loki’s wolf child), Jörmungandr (World Serpent), or Surtur (Fire Giant), with special mechanics where all characters' abilities are needed to defeat them.
Upgrade System:

Allow players to collect runes and upgrade their abilities, like increasing Thor's hammer strike radius, reducing Loki's illusion cooldown, or extending Odin's teleportation range.
Enhanced Storyline and Multiple Endings
Rich Story Arc: Tie the levels together with a storyline where players must prevent Ragnarok, the Norse end of the world. The decisions made during gameplay could affect the outcome, leading to multiple endings.
