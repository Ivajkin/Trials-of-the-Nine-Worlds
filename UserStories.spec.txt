User Stories for Top 3 JTBD
Now, weâ€™ll create User Stories for the top 3 JTBD.

User Story 1: Efficient Character Integration "As a game designer, I want characters to blend seamlessly with the landscape so that the game environment feels immersive for the players."

User Story 2: Improve In-Game Asset Loading "As a game developer, I want to optimize asset loading times so that the game runs smoothly and players don't experience delays or stuttering."

User Story 3: Optimize Visual Feedback Loops "As a visual artist, I want real-time rendering feedback so that I can identify visual issues and iterate quickly to improve the quality of in-game assets."

Step 4: Evaluate User Stories by WSJF

Step 5: Acceptance Criteria (AC) for Each User Story
User Story 1: Efficient Character Integration
AC1: Characters should cast realistic shadows on the environment, which change dynamically based on lighting conditions.
AC2: Characters should appear naturally embedded in the environment with matching color grading, lighting, and depth.
AC3: Ensure that character sprites do not appear "pasted on" by adjusting their scale to fit within the environment naturally.
AC4: Character movement should interact with environmental elements (e.g., water, grass, rocks).
User Story 2: Improve In-Game Asset Loading
AC1: Asset loading times must not exceed 2 seconds for large assets.
AC2: Implement lazy loading or background loading of assets when transitioning between levels or game states.
AC3: Introduce asset compression and memory management techniques to reduce loading times by 30%.
AC4: Conduct performance testing to ensure loading times are consistently optimized across different hardware configurations.
User Story 3: Optimize Visual Feedback Loops
AC1: Implement real-time rendering feedback for all visual elements, showing changes to lighting, textures, or character placement immediately in the game engine.
AC2: Ensure the rendering pipeline is efficient, with feedback loops running under 0.5 seconds per visual change.
AC3: Enable dynamic scaling or automatic adjustments to prevent rendering lag or overuse of GPU resources.
AC4: Provide visual comparison tools within the editor to compare different rendering iterations side by side.
