JTBD (Jobs to Be Done)
Here are five JTBD that could align with a project like "Gods of Asgard" or another tech-oriented development:

JTBD 1: Efficient Character Integration
"When designing in-game environments, I want to seamlessly integrate characters into the landscape so that the scene feels cohesive and immersive for players."

JTBD 2: Streamline Multitasking
"When working across multiple tools (design, code, task management), I want to minimize clutter and distractions so that I can efficiently switch tasks and focus on high-priority work."

JTBD 3: Optimize Visual Feedback Loops
"When developing visual assets (e.g., character sprites or environments), I want real-time feedback on rendering quality and integration issues so that I can quickly iterate and improve asset quality."

JTBD 4: Improve In-Game Asset Loading
"When loading assets into the game engine, I want fast and optimized processes to reduce waiting time and avoid performance bottlenecks during gameplay."

JTBD 5: Enhance Team Collaboration
"When collaborating with team members remotely, I want clear communication and version control so that the team can stay aligned, avoid miscommunication, and track changes effectively."

Evaluate JTBD by WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
WSJF prioritization is calculated by dividing the value a feature brings by its cost to implement. Here's how we can estimate WSJF:

Business Value (BV): How important is this task for the project's success?
Time Criticality (TC): How urgent is it to deliver this feature?
Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE): How much risk does it reduce or opportunity does it create?
Effort/Cost (C): The complexity and time needed to implement the task.
Formula: WSJF = (BV + TC + RR/OE) / C

JTBD	BV	TC	RR/OE	C	WSJF
1. Efficient Character Integration	8	6	7	3	7.00
2. Streamline Multitasking	6	5	6	4	4.25
3. Optimize Visual Feedback Loops	7	7	8	5	4.40
4. Improve Asset Loading	9	9	7	4	6.25
5. Enhance Team Collaboration	8	8	9	6	4.17
Top 3 JTBD (Based on WSJF):
JTBD 1: Efficient Character Integration (WSJF = 7.00)
JTBD 4: Improve In-Game Asset Loading (WSJF = 6.25)
JTBD 3: Optimize Visual Feedback Loops (WSJF = 4.40)
